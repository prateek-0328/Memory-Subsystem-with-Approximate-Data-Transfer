# Memory-Subsystem-with-Approximate-Data-Transfer
Implemented a memory subsystem consisting of an L1D cache and a main memory. Whenever there is a miss in L1D cache, an error tolerance information is sent along with the data request that aims to reduce power consumption. This project is implemented using the HDL language - SystemVerilog.
